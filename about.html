    <h1>Happy 17th Birthday, Roshni! 🎉</h1>
    <p>My Dearest Roshni,</p>
    <p>
      Today is all about <strong>you</strong>—your smile, your laughter, your dreams, and the incredible light you bring into my life every single day.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may be turning 17 today, but you’ve already given me countless memories to cherish. From the way you talk about your dreams to the way your eyes light up when you’re excited—every moment with you feels special.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this birthday, I just want you to know how much you mean to me. I hope your day is filled with laughter, surprises, sweet memories, and the love you truly deserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for being in my life, Roshni. I’m so proud of you—and I’ll always be here, cheering you on, supporting you, and loving you.
    </p>
    <p class="signature">With all my love,<br />Pawan❤️</p>
